the report should consist of 7 parts

Part 1: Names and IDs
=====================
B01902028 Shu-Ho, Chou.
B01902044 Yu-Chih, Lin.
B01902068 Brian Huang.
B01902078 Han-Hao, Chen.

Part 2: How to Divide the Responsibilities
==========================================
Firstly, Steven helped build the structure of this project.
And we spend a night at CSIE building to figure out how many parts were left to be filled.
[insert picture here]
And each of us picked 3 favorite items to determine the ultimate distribution.

Part 3: Relations Between the Classes
=====================================
 - Daifugo class
 - Card class
 - Hand class
 - Player class
    - HumanPlayer class
	- AIPlayer class
 - Deck class
 - Server class
 - Client class
 - Message class


Part 4: Advantages of Our Design
================================
1. The work of each player is independent of one another.
   It's better for group project since we didn't have to wait for others to finish their work first.
2. The efforts it takes to find bugs are alleviated significantly.

Part 5: Disadvantages of Our Design
===================================



Part 6: Packages We Used
========================
None.


Part 7: How to Play Our Game
============================
The steps are described below:
1) clone the repository first
2) use $make run to start the server
3) for human players, use $make run-client to connect to server
(P.S. human players need to know the IP address of server to create connection.)

The game logic and the rules can be found on wiki page, or our HackPad memo.
